break it down
ChatGPT
Certainly! Let's break it down step by step:

Expression Inside Parentheses:
2

- 1
  2+1
  Evaluate the sum:
  2
- # 1
  3
  2+1=3

Modulo Operation (% 12):
3
m
o
d



12
3mod12
Apply the modulo operation (remainder when divided by 12):
3
m
o
d



12
=
3
3mod12=3

Therefore,
(
2

- 1
  )
  m
  o
  d



12
=
3
(2+1)mod12=3. The result is 3.
