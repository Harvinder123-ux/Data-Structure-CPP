# Certainly! Let's go through the bubble sort algorithm step by step with a simple example array.

# Consider the array: [5, 3, 8, 4, 2]

# Pass 1 (i = 0):

# Compare and swap adjacent elements in the array:
# Compare 5 and 3 (swap): [3, 5, 8, 4, 2]
# Compare 5 and 8 (no swap)
# Compare 8 and 4 (swap): [3, 4, 8, 5, 2]
# Compare 8 and 2 (swap): [3, 4, 2, 5, 8]
# Array after Pass 1: [3, 4, 2, 5, 8]

# Pass 2 (i = 1):

# Compare and swap adjacent elements in the array:
# Compare 3 and 4 (no swap)
# Compare 4 and 2 (swap): [3, 2, 4, 5, 8]
# Compare 4 and 5 (no swap)
# Compare 5 and 8 (no swap)
# Array after Pass 2: [3, 2, 4, 5, 8]

# Pass 3 (i = 2):

# Compare and swap adjacent elements in the array:
# Compare 3 and 2 (swap): [2, 3, 4, 5, 8]
# Compare 3 and 4 (no swap)
# Compare 4 and 5 (no swap)
# Compare 5 and 8 (no swap)
# Array after Pass 3: [2, 3, 4, 5, 8]

# Pass 4 (i = 3):

# Compare and swap adjacent elements in the array:
# Compare 2 and 3 (no swap)
# Compare 3 and 4 (no swap)
# Compare 4 and 5 (no swap)
# Compare 5 and 8 (no swap)
# Array after Pass 4: [2, 3, 4, 5, 8]

# After each pass, the largest unsorted element "bubbles up" to its correct position at the end of the array. The number of passes is equal to the number of elements minus 1, and after each pass, the last element is sorted. The process continues until the entire array is sorted.



# Certainly! In the second pass (i = 1), the outer loop is controlling the number of passes, and the inner loop is comparing and swapping adjacent elements within the unsorted part of the array. Let's break down the steps:

# Array before Pass 2: [3, 4, 2, 5, 8]

# Inner Loop Iteration 1 (j = 0):

# Compare 3 and 4 (no swap): [3, 4, 2, 5, 8]
# Inner Loop Iteration 2 (j = 1):

# Compare 4 and 2 (swap): [3, 2, 4, 5, 8]
# The swap occurs because 4 is greater than 2, so we swap them.
# Inner Loop Iteration 3 (j = 2):

# Compare 4 and 5 (no swap): [3, 2, 4, 5, 8]
# Inner Loop Iteration 4 (j = 3):

# Compare 5 and 8 (no swap): [3, 2, 4, 5, 8]
